FileZilla.exe is the executable file associated with FileZilla, a popular open-source FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client used for transferring files between a local computer and a remote server. Developed by the FileZilla project, this software is widely utilized by web developers and system administrators for its user-friendly interface and robust functionality, supporting various protocols such as FTP, SFTP, and FTPS. The version 3.44.2.0 of FileZilla is considered safe and legitimate, and it is not categorized as a virus or malware; however, users should always ensure they download it from the official FileZilla website or trusted sources to avoid counterfeit versions that may carry malicious software. While FileZilla is generally stable, users may occasionally encounter errors such as connection timeouts, failed transfers, or issues related to incorrect server settings, which can often be resolved by checking configurations or updating the software to the latest version.
